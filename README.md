# Resize-JFXPanel-in-Swing
Resize a JFXPanel in Swing with respect to JFrame Resizing (Bind JFXPanel width and height to JFrame

I hab this problem where by after creating a JavaFX panel containing various components, the panel won't 
resize automatically in a JFrame in Swing using BorderLayout. So I opted to use GridBagLayout. Which works fine
as in the demo above.
